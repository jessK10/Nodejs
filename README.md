"This repository shows how to cret and work with a JavaScript object using different properties and methods."
- created an object 'student' with properties: 'name', 'age', and 'courses.'
- Modified the 'age' and added a new property 'grade'
- Added "math", "Physics", and "chemistry" to the 'Courses' array 'push()'.
- Used the 'indexof()' method to find the index of "physics".
- Used the 'slice()' method to creat a new array containing the first two elements of 'course'.
- logged the results, including the modified student object, index of "physics", and sliced array.
